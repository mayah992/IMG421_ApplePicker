# About
A unity game created for a class to familiarize myself with Unity.  A personalization of Apple Picker with three different Levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

# Controls
Use Mouse to slide basket back and forth across screen to catch the falling apples.

# Levels
Easy: Nice Crows carry the Apples to your basket

Medium: When you catch an apple, you build up dirt that blocks your vision. Quickly move the basket back and forth to shake the dirt off and repair your vision.

Hard: In addition to the dirt mechanic, every once in a while an evil crow will cross the screen. This evil crow will steal falling apples and has a chance of pooping on you, fully covering your screen in dirt.
